Purpose:
- If the item option:
    is a select
    is a matrix option
    is mandatory
    has only one value and that value:
        is not empty
        is available

    then sets up that value by default to the option.

    This can be noticed on the PDP, once the user enters, he doesn't have to set the options to add to cart.
